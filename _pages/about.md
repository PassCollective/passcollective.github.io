Our co-gender football club, Shining Stars FC, consists of 43 children from marginalised urban communities of Bangalore. On the field, we focus on football excellence and life skills development as a by-product. Off the field, we apply the our football club unity in academic study sessions, developing observation skills and participatory design projects addressing community challenges. The long term goal of PASS is for our children to shine in sport+creative livelihood opportunities where they are empathetic, skilled and find tremendous joy. <a href="/exercises">See exercises</a>.
